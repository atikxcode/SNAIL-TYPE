[VERY IMPORTANT RULES: DO NOT TEST ON BROWSER UNTIL I TELL YOU TO DO SO]

1. Still the typing feels not smooth. I want smooth typing experience. No matter what the situation. No matter their hardware. I want a smooth experience. A butter smooth transaction while typing. 
2. Read all the avaiable files present in the project. And find which files are not being used. They are created for a reason ofcourse find the reason and implement them. 
3. I want a Shotcut tab + enter will reset the typing. 
4. Do all the task related to the user interface and other stuff like finding weak key training program. Everything. Do everything. Now.
